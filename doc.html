	<h2>Mounter v0.4 by <a href="https://github.com/treexh">treexh</a></h2>
    <p>
        A graphical application for mounting / dismounting virtual disks
        using the Subst command provided by the MS-DOS operating system.
        The resulting virtual disk provides information from the specified
        directory. Switching to work with this virtual disk, the user or program
        gets access to the specified directory and subdirectories
    </p>
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <li>
        Unable to run .exe file with administrator rights on the mounted disk.
        See also the Subst command documentation for details on other restrictions.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        While running, the application consumes 0.2 ~ 1.5% of the processor,
        these resources are needed to support the child thread that supplies
        A <b> ListBox </b> widget with current disk letters information.
        If the application fails and the child stream will not stop, then you can
        stop this thread and the whole process through <b> Task Manager </b>.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        The application does not create configuration files.
    </li>
    <h3>Grafic Interface:</h3>
    <li>
        ListBox widget, which is updated at intervals of 1.0 seconds and displays
        the current number of free, busy and connected drive letters. When you select
        a drive letter, if you right-click, a context menu appears with the ability
        to copy the path to the connected directory to the clipboard. Drive letters
        used for mounting with the Subst command are displayed with a path pointing
        to a directory.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        The <b>Entry</b> widget contains the path to the directory that the user
        wants to mount. This widget also supports a context menu containing the
        following fields: Cut, Copy, Paste, Copy All; which are available
        by right-clicking.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        The <b>Browse</b> button opens a dialog box asking you to specify a
        directory for the mount. If you specify a directory, the path is placed
        in the <b>Entry</b> widget. Then you can select the desired free drive
        letter from the <b>Entry</b> widget and press the <b>Mount</b> button to
        mount the directory along the path specified in the <b>Entry</b> widget
        under the letter selected in the <b>ListBox</b> widget.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        When you click the <b>Mount</b> button, the directory along the path in
        the <b>Entry</b> widget is mounted under the drive letter that the user
        explicitly selected among the list items, or, if the letter is not
        specified, automatically selected the letter from the free ones. If in
        the <b>ListBox</b> widget you select the drive letter string that is
        used for mounting, the text of the <b>Mount</b> button will change to
        <b>Dismount</b>, and when you click on it, the selected directory will
        be dismounts.
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li>
        The <b>Quit</b> button performs a secure exit and the completion of all
        processes. For example, when pressed, the correct stopping of the child
        stream is guaranteed, which throughout the entire work of the program
        supplied the <b>ListBox</b> widget with up-to-date information about the
        drive letters.
