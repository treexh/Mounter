	<h2>Mounter v0.3.7.9.2</h2>

    <p>
        A graphical application for mounting / dismounting virtual disks
        using the Subst command provided by the MS-DOS operating system.
        The resulting virtual disk provides information from the specified
        directory. Switching to work with this virtual disk, the user or program
        gets access to the specified directory and subdirectories
    </p>
    
    <h4>Note:</h4>

    <li>
        Unable to run .exe file with administrator rights on the mounted disk.
        See also the Subst command documentation for other restrictions. 
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        During operation, the application consumes <b>0.2 ~ 1.5%</b> of the CPU,
        these resources are needed to support the child thread, which supplies
        the <b>ListBox</b> widget with up-to-date information about the drive
        letters. If the application fails and there is no command to terminate
        the child thread, then you can terminate this thread and the whole
        process through the <b>Task Manager</b>.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        The application does not create configuration files, so it is not
        possible to make any custom settings. This decision was made because the
        application is too small.
    </li>

    <h3>Grafic Interface:</h3>
    
    <li>
        The <b>ListBox</b> widget, which is updated at <b>1.0</b>-second
        intervals and displays the current number of free, busy, and connected
        drive letters. When you select a mounted drive letter, if you
        right-click, a context menu appears with the ability to copy the path
        to the mounted directory to the clipboard. Drive letters used for
        mounting with the Subst command are displayed with a path pointing to
        a directory.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        The <b>Entry</b> widget contains the path to the directory that the user
        wants to mount. This widget also supports a context menu containing the
        following fields: Cut, Copy, Paste, Copy All; which are available
        by right-clicking.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        The <b>Browse</b> button opens a dialog box asking you to specify a
        directory for the mount. If you specify a directory, the path is placed
        in the <b>Entry</b> widget. Then you can select the desired free drive
        letter from the <b>Entry</b> widget and press the <b>Mount</b> button to
        mount the directory along the path specified in the <b>Entry</b> widget
        under the letter selected in the <b>ListBox</b> widget.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        When you click the <b>Mount</b> button, the directory along the path in
        the <b>Entry</b> widget is mounted under the drive letter that the user
        explicitly selected among the list items, or, if the letter is not
        specified, automatically selects the letter from the free ones. If in
        the <b>ListBox</b> widget you select the drive letter string that is
        used for mounting, the text of the <b>Mount</b> button will change to
        <b>Dismount</b>, and when you click on it, the selected directory will
        be dismounts.
    </li>

    <p></p>

    <li>
        The <b>Quit</b> button performs a secure exit and the completion of all
        processes. For example, when pressed, the correct stopping of the child
        stream is guaranteed, which throughout the entire work of the program
        supplied the <b>ListBox</b> widget with up-to-date information about the
        drive letters.
